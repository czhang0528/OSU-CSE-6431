Basic idea: A diner waits for a table from Tables Queue,
puts his order in Orders Queue, waits for his order
being finished from ServeOrders Queue, eats and leaves.

A cook gets a order from Orders Queue, processes the 
order and puts the finished order back to ServeOrders Queue

********************************************************

Enclosed are all .java and .class files.

Restaurant is the main class.

execute "javac Restaurant.java" to compile the program

execute "java Restaurant inputFileName" to run the simulation with the name of input file.

For example:
execute "java Restaurant project-sample-input-1.txt" to run sample 1
execute "java Restaurant project-sample-input-2.txt" to run sample 2

!!!Please note that: the final left time might have 1 minute error because of System.currentTimeMillis() error. Just run the program again the get the right result.
